# QUAACK completed backlog.

Finished tasks move here from BACKLOG.md with their full entries. Don't reopen them. If one needs more work, add a new task to BACKLOG.md that points back to it.

## Foundations.

### 20260922-1. Project skeleton.

Set up the repo: package layout with separate driver and enclave packages, dependency management, test runner, and linting. The two packages must not import each other's internals, since they run on different machines.

- **Depends on:** None.
- **README:** Where QUAACK runs.
- **Status:** done
- **Decided:**
  - Ruby 3.4, with the pg_query gem. Ruby is already on the jump servers, and adding pg_query is simple. Locally, Ruby 3.4 is Homebrew's keg-only `ruby@3.4`.
  - Postgres 18 only.
  - Separate gems in one repo: a driver gem, an enclave gem, and a small shared gem for the protocol between them. The enclave gem never depends on the driver gem or the LLM SDK.
  - RSpec for tests. No hosted CI: the user has no use for GitHub CI, so the local `bundle exec rake` is the whole check.
  - The jump servers are ARM (`aarch64-linux`). Nothing needs x86_64.
- **Landed:** Merged into `main` after two reviews. The first review's findings were fixed in the builder's one fix round. The second review found no blockers, and its findings became 20260923-4 through 20260923-7. At landing, the main session removed the GitHub Actions workflow and the x86_64 lockfile platform, and corrected docs that overstated the runtime boundary check.

## Added later.

### 20260923-3. Rename the enclave gem to quaacks.

Rename the `quaack-enclave` gem and its executable to `quaacks`. The "s" stands for server, which pairs it with the driver's `quaack`. Update every reference, including the gemspec, the executable, the boundary and runtime specs, the allowlists, `CLAUDE.md`, and the backlog.

- **Depends on:** 20260922-1.
- **Came from:** The user, during 20260922-1.
- **README:** Where QUAACK runs.
- **Status:** done
- **Decided:**
  - The gem and executable are named `quaacks`.
  - Internal names stay as "enclave," such as the `enclave/` directory and the `Quaack::Enclave` module, to match the README's "enclave script." The README doesn't change.
- **Landed:** Merged into `main` after two reviews. The builder found that a check keyed on the literal `quaack-enclave` would have gone vacuous after the rename. Checks now read gem names from the gemspecs through a new `RepoGems` test helper. The first review found one vacuous test, which the fix round replaced. The second review found no blockers, and its minor findings became 20260923-8.

### 20260923-5. Discover spec suites instead of listing them.

Removing the root suite from `SPEC_SUITES` in the `Rakefile` turns off every boundary check, and `rake` stays green. That's because the spec that pins `SPEC_SUITES` lives in the root suite itself. Derive the suites from the directories that have a `spec/` folder, so there's nothing to forget.

- **Depends on:** 20260922-1.
- **Came from:** Second review of 20260922-1, finding 3.
- **README:** None. This is test infrastructure.
- **Status:** done
- **Landed:** Merged into `main` after two reviews. The Rakefile finds the suites from the root and each top-level directory with a `spec/` folder, leaving out `vendor/` and hidden directories. It runs every suite in its own process from its own directory, fails at the end if any suite failed or ran no examples, and fails if the root suite didn't run. The first review found that small edits could still drop the root suite with `rake` green, and the fix round added the root guard. The second review found no blockers, and its findings became 20260923-9 and 20260923-10.

### 20260923-4. Harden the runtime boundary check.

The runtime check in `spec/runtime_boundary_spec.rb` has two gaps:
- **It trusts the gemspec.** It builds its allowed set from the enclave gemspec's own dependency closure. If the enclave gains a dependency on `quaack-driver`, the check installs the driver and allows loading it. Only the dependency allowlist in `spec/boundary_spec.rb` catches that today. The runtime check should take the closure from that same allowlist, or assert that nothing loads from the driver gem or a known LLM gem.
- **It only runs `--version`.** A forbidden require in any other code path, such as `Kernel.enum_for("require", "quaack/driver").first` in the usage branch, passes every check. Make it also require every file under the installed gem's `lib/`. Write down what it still can't catch, like lazy loads inside method bodies.

- **Depends on:** 20260922-1.
- **Came from:** Second review of 20260922-1, findings 1 and 2.
- **README:** Where QUAACK runs.
- **Status:** done
- **Landed:** Squash-merged into `main` after two reviews, under the user's accident-only threat model: the boundary guards against honest mistakes, not a deliberate insider. The runtime check now takes the enclave's allowed gems from `Boundary::ENCLAVE_ALLOWED_GEMS`, the same allowlist the static check uses. It rejects anything loaded from the other side, and for the enclave any LLM SDK, whatever the gemspec says. Besides `--version` and the usage branch, it requires every file under each shipped repo gem's `lib/`, including `quaack-protocol`. The first review found that the protocol gem was never loaded, and the fix round covered it. The second review found no blockers. At landing, the main session corrected CLAUDE.md, which implied the driver can't load an LLM SDK. The review's other findings became 20260923-13.
